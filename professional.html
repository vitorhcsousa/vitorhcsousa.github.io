								<h2>Idioma de Tons</h2>
								<p>My first professional experience and it was an excellent experience. It allowed me to
									achieve my financial independence and thereby achieve what has always been my main
									goal, to go to university. I think it was one of the most critical periods of my
									life. All the work, dedication, and effort to be admitted to the university and then
									achieve positive results when I reconciled work and university, shaped my
									personality and identity. All my successes and achievements are due to the great
									personal development and growth that these years have provided me.</p>
								<hr>
								<h2>Pinto Brasil Group</h2>
								<span>My journey in Pinto Brasil Group was divided into 2 moments. A summer internship,
									combined with work at Idioma de Tons, and then full-time.</span>
								<h4>Summer Internship - Web Developer</h4>
								<p>Summer internship, from 15h to 20h, conciliated with my work at Idioma de Tons from
									06-14h.
									<br>
									During this period, I worked as a web developer on web solutions that the Research
									and Development department was developing. I integrated a team with 4 developers and
									during this period I worked on a few projects for web interfaces of the products
									that the department developed.

								</p>
								<p>Technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, HTML5, AJAX, CSS</p>
								<h4>Software Developer</h4>
								<p>At the end of the summer internship and I received an offer to work as a Software
									Developer in the R&D department, which I accepted.

									My work here was divided into 2 main parts. A project to develop an idea management
									solution, an investment and development project.</p>
								<b>Idea Management</b>
								<p>
									An idea management software to be able to follow up all suggestions from employees
									or
									customers, and that the whole process, until the creation of the project, if it was
									the
									case, was managed in this software. As a company with thousands of employees, and
									with
									some customers with very particular needs and requirements this was and is a tool to
									define which projects the department should start.</p>

								<p>Technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, HTML5, AJAX, CSS,Angular, TypeScript and C#.
								</p>

								<b>Research project - Prediction and identification of the moments of failure of the
									products of the department.</b>

								<p>Together with the electronics and mechanics team, we developed a project that through
									the analysis of sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.), operating history, etc...
									we
									tried to understand which are the failure moments and try to understand the reasons
									for
									these failures. Since the products(industrial machines) of the R&D department were
									new
									and in constant development until the incorporation of the product as a standard
									product
									of the company it was important to understand what are the possible improvements to
									get
									the most robust product possible.</p>

								<span>Technologies: Python, Java, Mongo DB, talend, Power BI</span>
								<hr>


								<h2>Valuekeep - PRIMAVERA BSS</h2>
								Here too, my path was divided into two distinct phases. As a software engineer and then,
								associated with the evolution of my academic career and my interest in the area, as a
								Data Scientist and Engineer
								<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
								The big project was the creation and development of a web solution for maintenance
								management. The "old" product was on outdated technologies, and I was the first member
								of the team to develop our solution on newer technologies that were more responsive to
								our customers. Besides developing the product, I was also involved in the rest of the
								product lifecycle, so I worked with the entire Azure environment to ensure best
								practices and CI/CD implementations.

								The technological basis of the solution is .NET/.NET Core (C#), SQL, EntityFramework,
								and Angular.

								<h4>Data Scientist & Engineer</h4>
								<span>The goal of the project is to develop a product that uses Machine Learning
									techniques to
									offer a Predictive Maintenance solution.</span> <br>

								<span>In this project, I was included in two teams, the Data Engineering team and the
									Data
									Science and Machine Learning team. This project has the participation of the
									Computer
									Graphics Centre (CCG), from the University of Minho, and I was the most technical
									contact point between Valuekeep and the CCG teams.</span><br>

								<span>In the Data Engineering, I was part of the micro-service responsible for the
									capture and storage of data in Azure Data Lake. I also developed pipelines for data
									transformation and processing, mainly using Azure Data Factory and
									Databricks.</span><br>

								<span>Regarding the Machine Learning and Data Science team, we developed a set of
									descriptive,
									exploratory, and causal analyses to data. We also explored Machine Learning
									techniques
									for two distinct objectives, the prediction of the number of time units until the
									next
									asset failure (regression problem) and the probability of asset failure in a given
									time
									window (binary classification). In this development, the Databricks tool was
									used.</span><br><br>

								<span>All the developments were done using Python, I also used PySpark. In terms of
									libraries,
									the most used were the following: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib,
									sklearn.</span>
								<hr>
								<h2>Sonae MC</h2>
								In this project, in the Advanced Analytics and Insight team, the goal in my team (6 Data
								Scientists) is to use data from the Continente Card (largest loyalty program in
								Portugal) to:

								<ul>
									<li>Support the strategic plan of the Marketing, Commercial and Operational areas,
										through
										the application of Machine Learning models and help the business in interpreting
										the
										results and complex relationships from the models applied to the Continente Card
										data;</li>
									<li>Use advanced statistical methodologies to generate insights;</li>
									<li>Adapt the techniques applied to the specific challenge: supervised and
										unsupervised
										models and text mining;</li>
									<li>Dealing with techniques/algorithms with performing adequate to large volumes of
										data
										(e.g. streaming modeling);</li>
									<li>Automate processes and implement data and model quality control methodologies;
									<li>Building a range of analytical models (Prescriptive, Predictive, Diagnostic,
										Descriptive)</li>
									<li>Building predictive and segmentation models (e.g. RFM segmentation, churn
										prediction,
										sentimental analysis, recommendation engines, next best offer, propensity
										scoring
										models, etc.) making use of relevant data from multiple data sources</li>
									<li>Deploying, maintaining and improving the models using various types of
										algorithms and
										techniques</li>
									<li>Mine data from multiple sources and to build/enhance stored procedures/functions
									</li>
									<li>Providing deep-dive analytical support for the business</li>
								</ul>
								Tecnologias: Python, PySpark, SQL, Databricks, Azure Data Factory

						As I mentioned earlier, my entire academic path was reconciled with full-time work. This was a
						big challenge, especially in the first year of university, since I have not studied for two
						years, getting back to the academic routines was difficult.
						<br>
						This 5-year course has great versatility, there are a set of courses that allow us to have
						strong knowledge about a wide variety of subjects, operating systems, distributed systems,
						software development, economics and finance, a set of mathematical courses (calculus, linear
						algebra, statistical methods), etc. It is possible to orient and specify the syllabus to a
						specific area, especially in the master's degree, we can orient our study to very different
						areas. As we can select part of the curricular units we have the possibility to deepen our
						knowledge in the areas of most interest. In my case, I always chose curricular units oriented to
						data science, machine learning, data visualization, and big data.
						<br>
						<p>Besides the technical skills, being a student worker allowed me to develop a set of other
							skills that are extremely important for me today.
							Soft skills like time and effort management, focus on the final result, discipline, my
							learning capacity was some of the points that I developed the most. I think I can optimize
							the way I acquire knowledge, and this was crucial for the course, but it's also very
							important now because in this world of data there is a constant evolution and being able to
							update myself and learn is one of the most important points so far in my career.
						</p>
						Despite being a student worker I am very proud of my entire path at university, I finished with
						an average of 15.4 marks. My master's thesis entitled "Artificial Intelligence for predictive
						maintenance" scored 17 points.
						Furthermore, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-91608-4_26"
							target="_blank"> paper</a> the paper developed based on this project won the Best IDEAL 2021
						conference paper award.
						<br>
						<br>
						During my path I was distinguished with some awards:
						<ul>
							<li>Mention of merit for performance in the curricular unit of Engineering of Work,
								Processes, and
								Organizations.</li>
							<li>Merit for my performance in the curricular unit of Systems for Business and Organization
								Intelligence.</li>
							<li><b>Excellence scholarship from the University of Minho- Distinguishes the students with
									the best academic performance.</b></li>
						</ul>
