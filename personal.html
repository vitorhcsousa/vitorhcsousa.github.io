											<h1>About Me</h1>
											<p>
												I am 26 years old, from Vizela, a small town in the north of Portugal.
											</p>

											<span>I really enjoy learning and I always fight for my goals. Being a
												student-worker
												during the 5 years of University demanded a lot from me and helped me
												grow
												and
												develop beyond the academic point of view. I think it was the period of
												my
												life
												that shaped me the most, because besides university and studies I always
												tried
												to make sure that I would have time for the important things in life -
												my
												family, girlfriend (now wife) and my friends.</span>
											<br>
											<span>I am very proud of my path, it was quite hard but being financially
												independent
												at 18 and being able to pay for my course and all the expenses that
												anyone
												has
												is one of the things I am most proud of.</span>
											<br>
											<br>
											<span>I think my parents and brother have always contributed a lot to this,
												we
												have
												always been very hard working and we were always clear that with hard
												work
												everything can be achieved.</span>

											<span> believe that we never stop learning, and especially in technological
												areas we
												always have to acquire new knowledge. So even today I try to dedicate
												some
												time
												of my week to deepen or acquire more knowledge.</span>

								<h2>Pinto Brasil Group</h2>
								<span>My journey in Pinto Brasil Group was divided into 2 moments. A summer
									internship,
									combined with work at Idioma de Tons, and then full-time.</span>
								<h4>Summer Internship - Web Developer</h4>
								<p>Summer internship, from 15h to 20h, conciliated with my work at Idioma de Tons
									from
									06-14h.
									<br>
									During this period, I worked as a web developer on web solutions that the
									Research
									and Development department was developing. I integrated a team with 4 developers
									and
									during this period I worked on a few projects for web interfaces of the products
									that the department developed.

								</p>
								<p>Technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, HTML5, AJAX, CSS</p>
								<h4>Software Developer</h4>
								<p>At the end of the summer internship and I received an offer to work as a Software
									Developer in the R&D department, which I accepted.

									My work here was divided into 2 main parts. A project to develop an idea
									management
									solution, an investment and development project.</p>
								<b>Idea Management</b>
								<p>
									An idea management software to be able to follow up all suggestions from
									employees
									or
									customers, and that the whole process, until the creation of the project, if it
									was
									the
									case, was managed in this software. As a company with thousands of employees,
									and
									with
									some customers with very particular needs and requirements this was and is a
									tool to
									define which projects the department should start.</p>

								<p>Technologies: JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, HTML5, AJAX, CSS,Angular, TypeScript and
									C#.
								</p>

								<b>Research project - Prediction and identification of the moments of failure of the
									products of the department.</b>

								<p>Together with the electronics and mechanics team, we developed a project that
									through
									the analysis of sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.), operating history,
									etc...
									we
									tried to understand which are the failure moments and try to understand the
									reasons
									for
									these failures. Since the products(industrial machines) of the R&D department
									were
									new
									and in constant development until the incorporation of the product as a standard
									product
									of the company it was important to understand what are the possible improvements
									to
									get
									the most robust product possible.</p>

								<span>Technologies: Python, Java, Mongo DB, talend, Power BI</span>

								<h2>Valuekeep - PRIMAVERA BSS</h2>
								Here too, my path was divided into two distinct phases. As a software engineer and
								then,
								associated with the evolution of my academic career and my interest in the area, as
								a
								Data Scientist and Engineer
								<h4>Software Engineer</h4>
								The big project was the creation and development of a web solution for maintenance
								management. The "old" product was on outdated technologies, and I was the first
								member
								of the team to develop our solution on newer technologies that were more responsive
								to
								our customers. Besides developing the product, I was also involved in the rest of
								the
								product lifecycle, so I worked with the entire Azure environment to ensure best
								practices and CI/CD implementations.

								The technological basis of the solution is .NET/.NET Core (C#), SQL,
								EntityFramework,
								and Angular.

								<h4>Data Scientist & Engineer</h4>
								<span>The goal of the project is to develop a product that uses Machine Learning
									techniques to
									offer a Predictive Maintenance solution.</span> <br>

								<span>In this project, I was included in two teams, the Data Engineering team and
									the
									Data
									Science and Machine Learning team. This project has the participation of the
									Computer
									Graphics Centre (CCG), from the University of Minho, and I was the most
									technical
									contact point between Valuekeep and the CCG teams.</span><br>

								<span>In the Data Engineering, I was part of the micro-service responsible for the
									capture and storage of data in Azure Data Lake. I also developed pipelines for
									data
									transformation and processing, mainly using Azure Data Factory and
									Databricks.</span><br>

								<span>Regarding the Machine Learning and Data Science team, we developed a set of
									descriptive,
									exploratory, and causal analyses to data. We also explored Machine Learning
									techniques
									for two distinct objectives, the prediction of the number of time units until
									the
									next
									asset failure (regression problem) and the probability of asset failure in a
									given
									time
									window (binary classification). In this development, the Databricks tool was
									used.</span><br><br>
								<p>Nominated for <b>Fast Shining Award</b> that distinguishes the revelation of the
									year.</p>
								<span>All the developments were done using Python, I also used PySpark. In terms of
									libraries,
									the most used were the following: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib,
									sklearn.</span>
								<hr>
								<h2>Sonae MC</h2>
								In this project, in the Advanced Analytics and Insight team, the goal in my team (6
								Data
								Scientists) is to use data from the Continente Card (largest loyalty program in
								Portugal) to:

								<ul>
									<li>Support the strategic plan of the Marketing, Commercial and Operational
										areas,
										through
										the application of Machine Learning models and help the business in
										interpreting
										the
										results and complex relationships from the models applied to the Continente
										Card
										data;</li>
									<li>Use advanced statistical methodologies to generate insights;</li>
									<li>Adapt the techniques applied to the specific challenge: supervised and
										unsupervised
										models and text mining;</li>
									<li>Dealing with techniques/algorithms with performing adequate to large volumes
										of
										data
										(e.g. streaming modeling);</li>
									<li>Automate processes and implement data and model quality control
										methodologies;
									<li>Building a range of analytical models (Prescriptive, Predictive, Diagnostic,
										Descriptive)</li>
									<li>Building predictive and segmentation models (e.g. RFM segmentation, churn
										prediction,
										sentimental analysis, recommendation engines, next best offer, propensity
										scoring
										models, etc.) making use of relevant data from multiple data sources</li>
									<li>Deploying, maintaining and improving the models using various types of
										algorithms and
										techniques</li>
									<li>Mine data from multiple sources and to build/enhance stored
										procedures/functions
									</li>
									<li>Providing deep-dive analytical support for the business</li>
								</ul>
								Tecnologias: Python, PySpark, SQL, Databricks, Azure Data Factory
