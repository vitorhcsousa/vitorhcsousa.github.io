											<h1>About Me</h1>
											<p>
												I am 26 years old, from Vizela, a small town in the north of Portugal.
											</p>

											<span>I really enjoy learning and I always fight for my goals. Being a
												student-worker
												during the 5 years of University demanded a lot from me and helped me
												grow
												and
												develop beyond the academic point of view. I think it was the period of
												my
												life
												that shaped me the most, because besides university and studies I always
												tried
												to make sure that I would have time for the important things in life -
												my
												family, girlfriend (now wife) and my friends.</span>
											<br>
											<span>I am very proud of my path, it was quite hard but being financially
												independent
												at 18 and being able to pay for my course and all the expenses that
												anyone
												has
												is one of the things I am most proud of.</span>
											<br>
											<br>
											<span>I think my parents and brother have always contributed a lot to this,
												we
												have
												always been very hard working and we were always clear that with hard
												work
												everything can be achieved.</span>

											<span> believe that we never stop learning, and especially in technological
												areas we
												always have to acquire new knowledge. So even today I try to dedicate
												some
												time
												of my week to deepen or acquire more knowledge.</span>
